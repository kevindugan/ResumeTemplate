I am interested in applying to positions in which I can cultivate a fulfilling career in the field of Software Engineering. I am applying to your position because I believe I can leverage my 7+ years of experience in software development to make significant contributions to TerraPower as a Nuclear Methods Developer.

My past experience has been oriented toward developing methods for coupling physics calculations together in robust frameworks. I have experience developing software using modern computational methods applied to nuclear engineering (deterministic/stochastic neutron transport, depletion, transient analysis, etc.). In my current position, I have worked with both the NEAMS and CASL projects to combine neutron transport, fuel performance, isotopic depletion, and cross section processing codes together under these programs. Additionally, in the last year of my experience, I have provided infrastructure support for a large nuclear analysis suite (SCALE) with around 50 active developers. In this role, I help other developers adhere to best practices in software development by setting up automated systems to continuously integrate their work into the SCALE repository. I believe I can readily apply my experience in software design and development to TerraPowerâ€™s tools.

Thank you in considering my application and I would be happy to answer any questions there may be of my experience.
