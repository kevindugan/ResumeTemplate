\section{Work History}
\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Postdoctoral Research Associate} \\
	\textsl{Oak Ridge National Laboratory} \\
	Reactor Physics Group 
}{June 2017 -- Present}{
	Working on the NEAMS Workbench to facilitate coupled physics simulations. Serving on the SCALE infrastructure team to bring engineering solutions to support developers.
}
	
\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Ph.D. Research Associate} \\
	\textsl{Commissariat \`a l'\'Energie Atomique (CEA)}, Saclay, FRANCE \\
	DEN/DM2S/SERMA/LTSD
}{October 2013 -- October 2016}{
	To build a multiphysics framework within the APOLLO3 software package. The framework will use matrix-free methods and will support coupling between neutron transport and thermal hydraulics. Special attention was devoted to the treatment of homogenized cross sections in transient simulations.
}

\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Graduate Research Assistant} \\
	\textsl{Texas A\&M University}, College Station, TX, USA \\
	Department of Nuclear Engineering
}{August 2011 -- August 2013}{
	To build a high fidelity model of coupled physics important to reactor analysis. The proposed method uses the mesh adaptive finite element method which can utilize the Deal.II FEM library written in C++. The physics modeled are two-group transient neutron diffusion and non-linear heat conduction.
}

\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Summer Internship} \\
	\textsl{Oak Ridge National Lab}, Oak Ridge, TN, USA \\
	Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division
}{May 2012 -- August  2012}{
	Built a tool for the SCALE suite that evaluates how manufacturing tolerances impact the behavior of k-eff. This tool also handles the situation where parameters within a model are correlated and when possible correlations exist between different models. The tool was later incorporated in the SCALE~6.2 release.
}

\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Reactor Operator/ Health Physicist} \\
	\textsl{Nuclear Science Center}, College Station, TX, USA
}{May 2009 -- May 2011}{
	A reactor operator ensures the safe operation of the reactor facility, and also performs necessary maintenance on the reactor (1MW TRIGA). A health physicist performs environmental surveys on the facility and conducts analysis experiments using the available reactor.
