\section{Work History}
\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Software Engineer III}
	\textsl{Woolpert}
	Digital Innovations
}{May 2023 -- Present}{
	My current focus is on delivering a cloud-based High Performance Computing environment
	for the US Army Corps of Engineers. This environment is designed to deliver on demand
	computing resources for modeling and simulation for coastal processes. 	
}

\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Scientific Software Engineer}
	\textsl{ExxonMobil}
	Scientific Computing Group
}{April 2019 -- March 2023}{
	As part of a team which provides computational support for our research organization, I focused
	on improving energy production and carbon sequestration. Specifically I focused on our physics
	based simulation problems or machine learning problems. I leveraged my experience with high
	performance computing (parallel computing with MPI, Linux, C++), algorithmic design (Python,
	Data Structures, Analysis), and software engineering (DevOps, Design Patterns, Architecture) to
	accelerate our research directions. I also have lead a self-study group focused on improving the
	parallel computing skills of my team and have given several seminars on the same subject.

\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Postdoctoral Research Associate} \\
	\textsl{Oak Ridge National Laboratory} \\
	Reactor Physics Group 
}{June 2017 -- February 2019}{
	Working on the NEAMS Workbench to facilitate coupled physics simulations. Serving on the SCALE
	infrastructure team to bring engineering solutions to support developers.
}
	
\datedContentDescription{
	\textbf{Ph.D. Research Associate} \\
	\textsl{Commissariat \`a l'\'Energie Atomique (CEA)}, Saclay, FRANCE \\
	DEN/DM2S/SERMA/LTSD
}{October 2013 -- October 2016}{
	To build a multiphysics framework within the APOLLO3 software package. The framework will use
	matrix-free methods and will support coupling between neutron transport and thermal hydraulics.
	Special attention was devoted to the treatment of homogenized cross sections in transient
	simulations.

% 	\textbf{Graduate Research Assistant} \\
% 	\textsl{Texas A\&M University}, College Station, TX, USA \\
% 	Department of Nuclear Engineering
% }{August 2011 -- August 2013}{
% 	To build a high fidelity model of coupled physics important to reactor analysis. The proposed
% 	method uses the mesh adaptive finite element method which can utilize the Deal.II FEM library
% 	written in C++. The physics modeled are two-group transient neutron diffusion and non-linear
% 	heat conduction.

% \datedContentDescription{
% 	\textbf{Summer Internship} \\
% 	\textsl{Oak Ridge National Lab}, Oak Ridge, TN, USA \\
% 	Reactor and Nuclear Systems Division
% }{May 2012 -- August  2012}{
% 	Built a tool for the SCALE suite that evaluates how manufacturing tolerances impact the behavior
% 	of k-eff. This tool also handles the situation where parameters within a model are correlated
% 	and when possible correlations exist between different models. The tool was later incorporated
% 	in the SCALE~6.2 release.

% \datedContentDescription{
% 	\textbf{Reactor Operator/ Health Physicist} \\
% 	\textsl{Nuclear Science Center}, College Station, TX, USA
% }{May 2009 -- May 2011}{
% 	A reactor operator ensures the safe operation of the reactor facility, and also performs
% 	necessary maintenance on the reactor (1MW TRIGA). A health physicist performs environmental
% 	surveys on the facility and conducts analysis experiments using the available reactor.
